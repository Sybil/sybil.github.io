### Ubiquitous language

- Common/shared language
- Common dictionary of words
- Language of the product, rather than "engineering" language (e.g. "connectors" - collection of tasks)
- Standard industry terms
- Expressed in the code

### Bounded context

Context boundaries are when the shared language change

### Design patterns

Interaction between domains/teams/services

- Conformist: One team follows domain defined by another team
- Paternship: Team collaborates to define their domain
- Open host: 

### DDD and DB

How isomorphic is the domain with the DB ?

### Aggregates

They would be persisted in different DB transactions ideally (so can improve performance)
