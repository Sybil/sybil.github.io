Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ... I mean, hi!

Let's hope this place will see the light more than once. I plan to mainly talk about development.

When working in any kind of field it's difficult to believe we have things to bring to the table. Very smart and passionate people are paid to do research and think all day about complex problems. What could I say more than what I read from them ?

Even tho, most of the writing today is around new fancy techs, very specific implementations, smart optimizations. I want to share grounded impressions and high level guts feelings.

I believe nobody will ever find this blog and I don't plan to advertise it.
